# Workshop Description
Data visualization helps us to understand our data, infer patterns, and communicate our insights. Join us for our Visualization for Data Science workshop to learn the basics of this impactful tool using Python, arguably the most popular language to do data science. We will guide you through the essentials of creating meaningful, impactful, and aesthetically pleasing visual representations of data, from exploratory data analysis to presentation-ready graphics. You will get the chance to try out these new skills on simple data sets and get feedback on your designs from peers. No data visualization experience is required, but some familiarity with the basics of Python is useful.
