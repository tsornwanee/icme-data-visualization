# Workshop Description
Data visualization helps us to understand our data, infer patterns, and communicate our insights. Join us for our Visualization for Data Science workshop to learn the basics of this impactful tool using Python, arguably the most popular language to do data science. We will guide you through the essentials of creating meaningful, impactful, and aesthetically pleasing visual representations of data, from exploratory data analysis to presentation-ready graphics. You will get the chance to try out these new skills on simple data sets and get feedback on your designs from peers. No data visualization experience is required, but some familiarity with the basics of Python is useful.

## Class outcome
After this class, you will:
1. Know the principles of data visualization necessary for effective data communication
2. Become familiar with the possibilities and processes for creating professional-looking visualizations in Python
3. Gain an appreciation of a key data science functional technique called exploratory data analysis


## About the Instructor
![Kaleigh Mentzer](/assets/img/profile.jpg){:style="max-width:30%;"}

Kaleigh is a research engineer working on large-scale data problems for a stealth startup. She recently completed her Ph.D. from ICME at Stanford. Her doctoral work on computational approaches to improving equitable access to education in the San Francisco Unified School District (with professors Irene Lo and Itai Ashlagi) has influenced recent education policy decisions in the city.

## Prerequisites
This workshop is designed to be accessible to beginners with basic experience with Python, on the level of workshop SWS 02  (Introduction to Python). 

Our goal is to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment, and we want all students to succeed. However, to set you up for success, we also want to clearly communicate the necessary level of prior programming familiarity. If you are unsure whether you have the required background, please feel free to reach out for guidance.

## Requirements

To join the workshop, you'll need a device with a recent web browser and two-way audio and video access to Zoom. This could be a laptop or desktop computer running any operating system, such as Windows, Mac, or Linux. Participative activities benefit from a larger screen, so joining via a smartphone or tablet may not provide the best learning experience. 

You do not need to install Python or any other software before the workshop. We will provide more detailed instructions prior to the start to ensure that you are set up and ready to learn.

# Syllabus Outline
This class will cover key data visualization skills for data science applications. 
1. Why Data Visualization 
  - Why do we need data visualization to understand our data? 
  - Roles of data visualization
  - Research example
2. Data Visualization for Yourself: Exploratory Data Analysis
  - What is exploratory data analysis (EDA)? 
  - Nominal, ordinal, and quantitative data
  - Missing or invalid data
  - Bar charts, scatter plots, line plots with error bands, histograms, box plots, heatmaps, pearplots
  - Implementation in Python 
    * Loading and exploring data with pandas
    * pandas-profiling/ydata-profiling
    * Introduction to matplotlib and seaborn 
    * How to navigate package documentation
  - Exercise: EDA of sample data sets
3. Data Visualization for Others: Communicating Findings
  - What should you consider when designing for communication? How is it different from EDA? 
  - Human visual perception considerations for data visualization design
  - Colors and accessibility 
  - Titles, labels, and annotation
  - Data storytelling
  - Positive and negative data visualization examples
  - Exercise: Build a visualization and get peer feedback on design
  - Extensions (maps, graphs, animation, interactivity)
